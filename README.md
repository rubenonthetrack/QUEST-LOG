## What is it ?

QuestLog lets you set goals for yourself as if they were RPG quests.  
Write a quest, give it a color, accept it — and track your progress like an adventurer.

You also have a **Notes** tab to record your findings along the way.

Your data can be **exported and imported as JSON** so nothing is ever lost.
