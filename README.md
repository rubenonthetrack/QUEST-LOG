A personal quest tracker built like an RPG adventure log.

## What is it ?

QuestLog lets you set goals for yourself as if they were RPG quests.  
Write a quest, give it a color, accept it — and track your progress like an adventurer.

There is no backend server: all information is stored in the browser using `localStorage`.  
This means the app works offline and can be served as a static site (e.g. GitHub Pages).

Your data can still be **exported and imported as JSON** so nothing is ever lost.
